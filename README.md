•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
o	Crowdfunding events under the parent category publishing had the highest rate of success
o	Most crowdfunding campaign events were held for theater parent category
o	Most crowdfunding campaigns held around June – July had the highest rate of success
•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
o	Limitations of this dataset would be how the data was collected across the different countries throughout the years, canceled and live events being included in the datasets, extreme values (outliers) that exists in the dataset, how parent categories were determined
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
o	Pivot table of parent category and average donation; this would show how much donation (give a comparison) was generated for each parent category
o	Pivot table of sub categories that breaks down each parent category and the average donation for each sub category; this would give a further breakdown of average donations for each sub category
•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
o	The median summarizes the data better in both successful and unsuccessful datasets  than the mean because there are extreme values to both successful and unsuccessful datasets (minimum and maximum values are at extreme).
•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
o	According to the data, there is more variability with successful campaigns. This was not expected because there were more data points in the for the successful campaign dataset; the more data a dataset has, the less likely the dataset is to be variable.
